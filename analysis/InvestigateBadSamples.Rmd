I have two samples that are not making a lot of sense. They cluster in the raw data by speices but in the normalized data they switch sides. Also removing these samples greatly improves the DE analysis. I want to make sure these are not switched samples. To test this I will map 4973 to the human genome and 18498 to the chimp genome. I can run verify bam id to see if 4973 maps well to a human.  

```{bash,eval=F}
mkdir ../data/TwoBadSampleAnalysis
sbatch MapBadSamples.sh
sbatch SortIndexBadSamples.sh
sbatch verifyBam4973inHuman.sh

```


4973 verifies as 18498....


Look at rate of mismatch per base.

18498:
human: 0.87%
chimp: 0.14%


4973:
human: 0.16%
chimp:0.84%


This is a sample swap. FIX AND RERUN!
