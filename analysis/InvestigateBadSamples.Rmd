I have two samples that are not making a lot of sense. They cluster in the raw data by speices but in the normalized data they switch sides. Also removing these samples greatly improves the DE analysis. I want to make sure these are not switched samples. To test this I will map 4973 to the human genome and 18498 to the chimp genome. I can run verify bam id to see if 4973 maps well to a human.  

```{bash,eval=F}
mkdir ../data/TwoBadSampleAnalysis
sbatch MapBadSamples.sh
sbatch SortIndexBadSamples.sh
sbatch verifyBam4974inHuman.sh

```
