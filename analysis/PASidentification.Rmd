```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I use 3 snakefiles to get from fastq to an inclusive set of PAS in each speices. By inclusive set I mean the peak location must be non 0 in 90% of the samples and have an average read count of at least 2.  These PAS have been cleaned for MP using the 15bp filter I


```{bash,eval=F}
#read mapping and cleaning
sbatch snakemake_human.batch
sbatch snakemake_chimp.batch

#PAS calling
sbatch snakemakePASchimp.batch
sbatch snakemakePAShuman.batch

#pas filter/clean
sbatch snakemakefiltPAS_human.sh
sbatch snakemakefiltPAS_chimp.sh

```
