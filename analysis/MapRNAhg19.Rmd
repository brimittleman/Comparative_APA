```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I have high levels of multi mapping in these samples. I want to test if this is the case in hg19 as well. I can try with 1 or 2 samples.

```{bash,eval=F}
mkdir ../Human/data/RNAseq/bam_hg19
sbatch mapRNAseqhg19.sh  
```

18504
hg19: multi map= 15.24 (83% map) 
hg38:  multi map= 21.39% (77.52% map)


18510-
hg19: multimap = 14.46% (83.97% map)
hg38: multimap= 21.39% (77.52% map)
